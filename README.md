## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learnt how to make a website responsive to various screen sizes.
- I made every effort to steer clear of setting specific heights.
- Ensured the use of percentage (%) for widths except in cases where i wanted it to be fixed, I made use of pixels.
- Made use of rem and em except in cases I intentionally wanted it to be fixed.

### Continued development

- My focus now is to build responisve layouts with ease and explore additional methods/techniques in HTML and CSS that will enhance my speed in coding and in the organization and efficiency of my codes.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This helped me learn some basics in creating responsive layouts. Just 1-week into the course as of the time I built this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand HTML and CSS basics. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
